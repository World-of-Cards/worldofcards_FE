# WorldOfCards Frontend
React App to compliment the [WOC Backend](https://github.com/KZellweger/worldofcards_BE).
## Development
### Testing strategy
- We are using the test-first methodology so we write tests before any production code
- All components are tested thoroughly with unit tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io)
- All pages are tested with end-to-end tests using [Cypress](https://cypress.io)


## Features

accessible through multiple means of search as well as uploading a personal
collection.
